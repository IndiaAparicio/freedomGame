                <h3>Based on your decisions in this game you gained a lot of points for your collective freedom.</h3>
                <p>
                    The game should visualize this interaction between individual and collective freedom. 
                    Your game behavior has resulted in a high value of individual freedom. 
                    Thus, with similar decisions in the pandemic, the person acting would experience 
                    many "freedoms," but this would limit the freedom of the collective. 
                    The concept of freedom would shift to the purely personal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the game, the background grayed out at a low collective value, 
                    while the individual increased in detail. Hitting groups or ignoring 
                    the mask requirement makes the individual freedom value increase, 
                    but hurts the collective one. Nevertheless, there would be actions 
                    which let the individual freedom - without massive bookings of the 
                    collective - rise, like individual meetings with mask or the stay in the fresh air. 
                    So could also both values increase?
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>What exactly is the difference between collective and individual freedom?</h3>
                <p>
                    Freedom is a term that is often used in everyday language. 
                    But what does freedom actually mean? Is it about the individual experience and the possibility to make 
                    independent decisions? But if we grant everyone unrestricted freedom of action, 
                    others will also be influenced by these supposedly "free" actions - 
                    perhaps they will even be restricted in their own freedom of action. 
                    Is individual freedom in communities then possible at all? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To live completely - in today's parlance - "free" in a society is not only difficult 
                    because society-specific norms and traditions subtly influence the individual, 
                    but also because freedom should not be seen as something purely individual, 
                    which can already be traced back to Hegel. Thus, understanding freedom as something purely 
                    individual cannot work in a group-oriented society - at least not in such a way that the entire group 
                    can be "free."
                </p>
                <p>
                    When freedom is seen not only as something individual, but also as something collective, 
                    a tension arises between these two concepts. Individual and collective freedom are interrelated, 
                    between which the agent can weigh. The freedom that one wants to take for oneself should also be granted to others. 
                    Effects of action should not restrict others too much in their freedom. Thus also already Hegel said that some 
                    allegedly freedom-robbing actions do not restrict freedom, but only guarantee it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accordingly, the measures of the Corona pandemic are not merely freedom-restricting 
                    for the individual, but also freedom-giving for the collective: the measures prevent 
                    many people from falling ill, which could result in the loss of their freedom, 
                    for example through death. Thus, if the potentially freedom-restricting effect of 
                    action is weighed before action is taken, it may be possible to choose a path that is 
                    freedom-maximizing - for the individual and the group - in the aggregate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interaction and relationship between freedoms is not unique to the Corona pandemic. 
                    Also in consideration of other issues - like climate change or the consumption of cheap products (and much more) - 
                    actions could limit or expand the different freedoms.
