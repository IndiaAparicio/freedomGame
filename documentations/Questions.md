### Can I store a Class in a sprite (p5.play.js)? Something seems to change with the collider.
### Frame in frame 
### How to slowly change background
### New JS files only make sense for classes?
### Do I need CSS / HTML? For example for the camera movement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Fn33lYuE0) -> when I want to place a platform but my BG is moving, what values do I use?
