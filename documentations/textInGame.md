This game is about freedom. It functions as a visualization of the dependence of different forms of freedom. By means of different "freedom-restricting" measures, freedoms can be influenced. 

You can move in the following game with the four arrow keys and jump with the spacebar. At the upper left edge there are the two scores "collective" and "individual", which are influenced by different objects in the game world. The game ends when you reach certain scores. 

If you get stuck, you can click on the play button in the upper right corner to see which objects influence the scores and how.  

Have fun


The cage - the mask 
The mask restricts individual freedom in the long run, but increases collective freedom in the long run. 

The rain - disinfection and hygiene
By disinfecting, the collective freedom gets a boost. However, disinfecting too often does nothing.

Swarms - Groups
In the upper third of the game world, you can fly, which greatly increases individual freedom, but there is a large deduction of collective freedom when you meet a group of people.

Masked Bubbles - Individual Contacts 
The masked bubbles in the middle level are individual people you meet. They improve the individual value and worsen the collective one.
