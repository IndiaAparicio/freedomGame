# Best and Worst Case Scenarios

## Best Case:
- Functioning game that is also fun to play 
- Scoring system makes sense and is possible 
- With 4 different possible endings, which also describe theoretical background knowledge about freedom, i.e. you can read something about your decisions at each ending
All 6 different interaction possibilities work
- Adding Sound and Music 
- Adding a lot of animations and not just images
- All Affordances/Signifier are clear and work 
- Test the game with some people and fix all bugs and improve weaknesses
- The design of the game is appealing and above all the transfer of the design to the content information about the values of collective and individual freedom works. 
- Maybe include a questionmark-side, where the user can find hints (for example the different interactions, which can change the values are listed in there) -> Maybe make it as the starting page so the user has to think while playing what might influence the individual and collective freedom value -> maybe test what works better

## Worst Case
- Game only works to a limited extent 
- Scoring system does not work and some endings are impossible to „solve“
- The game is boring or the content is not understandable 
- Less than the 6 interactions are working
- No theoretical background 
- No or only just a few sounds will be added 
- No animations, only images will be included
- Only 1-3 different design styles depending on performance
